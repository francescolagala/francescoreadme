###  ADD Project.class to model:

Adding this class you'll need to create also ProjectDTO.class, ProjectDao interface, correct mappipng, and custom services.

### Custom Many to Many relationship:

The example provided by baeldung is an easy way to implement a many to many relation. The join-table is auto-generated by hibernate.
How to provide a custom join table?

###  Create a Primary Key for your jointable:

```
@Data
@Embeddable
public class EmployeeProjectPK implements Serializable {

    @Column(name = "EMPLOYEE_ID")
    private Integer id;

     @Column(name = "PROJECT_ID")
    private Integer projectid;
    
    ...
     
}

```

###  Create the jointable class whit custom fields:

```
@Data
@Entity
@Table(name = "EmployeeProject")
public class EmployeeProject implements Serializable {

   @EmbeddedId
   private EmployeeProjectPK epid;

   @ManyToOne
   @MapsId("id")
   @JoinColumn(name = "EMPLOYEE_ID")
   private Employee employee;

   @ManyToOne
   @MapsId("projectid")
   @JoinColumn(name = "PROJECT_ID")
   private Project project;
  
  // We've choosen this strategy to save two informations:
  // when an employee starts to work on a project and when he will end to work on it.
  
	@Column
	@Temporal(TemporalType.DATE)
	private Date start;
	
	@Column
	@Temporal(TemporalType.DATE)
	private Date end;

  ...
}
```

###  Employee.class

```
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "employee")
Set <EmployeeProject> employeeEP = new HashSet <EmployeeProject>();	
```

###  Project.class:

```
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "project")
Set <EmployeeProject> projectEP = new HashSet <EmployeeProject>();
```
